# Overview 
After visiting New York Kate is interested in starting a bike share business for her hometown Des Moines, Iowa. Kate starts to brainstorm and finally found a potential invester for her business. To succeed in the business first, we looked at how the bike-share business works in New York City. Then we will create a proposal on how it might also work in Des Moines, Iowa.Then I used my knowldge in data-analytics to analyse the 2019-08 citybike data from New york City. 

## Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines will be a very successful business.

To pursuade investers, we will show them a bike trip analysis. We will analyze following;
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
